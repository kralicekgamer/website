                    Vietcong is a first-person shooter game developed by Pterodon and Illusion Softworks, released in
                    2003. Set during the Vietnam War, players take on the role of Sergeant First Class Steve R. Hawkins,
                    leading a U.S. Special Forces team through various jungle missions. The game emphasizes realism with

                    a gripping depiction of the war's challenges and intensity.
